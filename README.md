# ssscanner

Set of tools for people in need to scan SS.LV for various information. Scripts are currently customized from the source code, thus some developer skill needed to set them up.

Currently two scripts are inlcuded:
* ssscanner.php: Scanning advert lists and sending email notification for each new advert.
* ssmap.html: Real-estate objects mapper. Displays map with objectes as circles where radius is it's area and color is price. Demo available at [rawgit.com hosted page](https://rawgit.com/erik-ropez/ssscanner/master/ssmap.html). Currently you need to overcome Allow-Control-Allow-Origin header limitation. For example, in Crome you can use ["Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *" extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog).
